# Assignment

## Introduction

Our intern Dan is working on this killer Movie Quotes App that returns a random movie quote. Right now all it does is render a blank screen in the web browser. Fork the repository found here and help Dan fix it. Â 

## Running the Server

In order to run the server sucessfully please make sure you have node and npm installed on your computer. I am using npm version 6.9.0 and node version 11.4.0.  Then make sure install your node package dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

Then run the following command to spin up your web server on your local machine:

`node index.js`

And finally visit "http://localhost:3000/" in your web browser and visit the page to see the quote being rendered to the screen. Every time you refresh, you should be getting a new movie quote.
